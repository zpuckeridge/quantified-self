### What does "quantified self" mean?

Quantified self is a movement that involves using technology to track and analyze personal data related to various aspects of one's life, such as physical activity, sleep, diet, mood, and productivity. By collecting and analyzing this data, individuals can gain insights into their behaviors and make informed decisions about how to improve their health and well-being. This movement has been fueled by the development of wearable devices and smartphone apps that make it easier than ever to track and analyze personal data.

Please note: This project is currently a work in progress and is not ready for production.
